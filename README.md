A Facebook messenger bot based on a finite state machine

The goal is to implement the service on the [timing facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/timingdance/)

You can leave some information about the dance event that you really hope everyone know it or simply just want to share!

And you can get the infornation about the dance event take place in this month or on the specific day.

This bot will make a post automaticlly,so making it easier for manage a page!!

## Setup

### Prerequisite
* Python 3
* Facebook Page and App
* HTTPS Server(bottle)
* other requirments described in 'requirements.txt'

#### Install Dependency
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* pygraphviz (For visualizing Finite State Machine)
    * [Setup pygraphviz on Ubuntu](http://www.jianshu.com/p/a3da7ecc5303)

#### Secret Data

`VERIFY_TOKEN`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN` in local.py **MUST** be set for webhook connection.

`client_id`, `client_secret`, `album_id`, `access_token`, and `refresh_token` in local.py **MUST** be set for uploading to imgur.

The json document `serviceAccount.json` also **MUST** be set for firebase.
Otherwise, you might not be able to run your code.

#### Get ACCESS_TOKEN
create a facebook page

Login with your account on facebook develop

Create a messenger app

Get `ACCESS_TOKEN` from messenger app

#### Get local.py done
Create an app on your imgur account,then you will get your `client_id` and `client_secret`

Click into the album, getting your `album_id` from the end of line in URL

Run `auth.py` for getting `access_token` and `refresh_token`

#### How to `serviceAccount.json`
Create a firebase account.

Go to firestore\database,then you can download the json from the `rule`
#### Run Locally
You can either setup https server or using `ngrok` as a proxy.

**`ngrok` would be used in the following instruction**

```sh
./ngrok http 3000
```

After that, `ngrok` would generate a https URL.

#### Run the sever

```sh
python3 app.py
```
